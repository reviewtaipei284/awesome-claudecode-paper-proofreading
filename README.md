## :rocket: Overview

Two Claude Code prompts for rigorous proofreading of LaTeX research papers, designed for robotics and computer vision submissions at ICRA, RSS, CVPR, RA-L, and T-RO level.

The workflow is **two-phase**: Claude detects and lists all issues with unique numbers `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`... — then waits. The user selects which issues to fix or discard before any file is modified.

## :bust_in_silhouette: About the Author

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4af4b29f-ce85-47a0-9472-406f2ca95572" alt="Hyungtae Lim" width="75%"/></p>

These prompts are distilled from years of hands-on paper reviewing and mentoring experience by **[Hyungtae Lim](https://github.com/LimHyungTae)**, a researcher in robotics and 3D perception.

- 📝 **Associate Editor**, IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)
- 🌟 **RSS Pioneer 2024**
- 🎖️ **ICRA 2025 Outstanding Reviewer** — selected from 7,400+ reviewers
- 📄 **Conducted 100+ paper reviews** across top robotics and CV venues

The review rules in these prompts reflect the standards expected at top robotics and computer vision venues, refined through real annotated paper reviews across ICRA, RA-L, RSS, CVPR, AAAI, and BMVC submissions.

## :page_facing_up: Prompts

### [`prompts/01_latex_workspace_review.md`](prompts/01_latex_workspace_review.md)

**LaTeX infrastructure audit** — detects workspace-level errors before submission.

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| C1 | Preamble configuration (`hyperref`, `cleveref`, `caption` setup) |
| C2 | Package load order & conflicts |
| C3 | Macro safety, `\methodname` consistency, subscript macros, `\etalcite` |
| C4 | Cross-reference consistency (multi-ref, subcaption `Fig. 5(a)` format) |
| C5 | Label naming conventions, duplicate labels |
| C6 | Citation & bibliography integrity, duplicate BibTeX keys |
| C7 | Figure & table safety (missing files, dummy figures, label placement) |
| C8 | Hidden human errors (TODOs, inconsistent naming, `\vspace` hacks) |
| C9 | Academic writing patterns detectable in source (`\ie`, `\eg`, units) |

### [`prompts/02_paper_proofreading.md`](prompts/02_paper_proofreading.md)

**Paper content proofreading** — acts as a strict conference-level reviewer.

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| A | Language & grammar, tense consistency, Related Work tense |
| B | Language quality & awkward expression: typos, nominalization, filler phrases, citation-as-noun style |
| C | Scientific clarity: overclaiming, "significantly", unsupported claims |
| D | Structure & flow: intro claims, experiment purpose, equation narrative |
| E | Figure/table/caption review: self-containedness, reference order, quantitative consistency |
| F | LaTeX formatting: units, thousand separators, `\ie`/`\eg` macros |
| G | Abstract (WHY→PROBLEM→HOW→RESULTS) & conclusion quality |
| H | Notation consistency: symbol overload, boldface vectors, coordinate frames |
| I | Hyphenation: compound adjectives, `-ly` adverb rule |

## :hammer: How to Use

These prompts are used from **inside your paper workspace**, not from inside this repository.
The `@` file reference in Claude Code resolves paths relative to the directory where `claude` is launched.

### Setup — Clone this repo once

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LimHyungTae/awesome-claudecode-paper-proofreading.git ~/awesome-claudecode-paper-proofreading
```

### Step 1 — Navigate to your paper workspace and launch Claude Code

```bash
cd /path/to/your/paper
claude
```

### Step 2 — Run the workspace audit first

In the Claude Code session, reference the prompt by its **absolute path**, then attach your paper files:

```
@~/awesome-claudecode-paper-proofreading/prompts/01_latex_workspace_review.md

@main.tex @shortcuts.tex
```

### Step 3 — Run the content proofreader

Provide the root `.tex` file and the compiled PDF. The prompt automatically instructs Claude to follow all `\input{...}` calls and read every included section file:

```
@~/awesome-claudecode-paper-proofreading/prompts/02_paper_proofreading.md

@main.tex @paper.pdf
```

> **Why the PDF?**
> The compiled PDF lets Claude cross-check two things invisible in source alone:
> - **Figure placement** — figures displaced far from their in-text reference
> - **PDF-level annotations** — leftover review comments not yet resolved

### Step 4 — Decide which issues to fix

After Phase 1 output, respond with:

```
discard 3, 7, 12    ← skip specific issues
fix all critical    ← fix only CRITICAL issues
proceed with all    ← fix everything
```

### Alternative — Copy prompt into `CLAUDE.md`

If you want the prompt to activate automatically whenever you open a paper project with Claude Code, copy the relevant prompt content into a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of your paper workspace:

```bash
cp ~/awesome-claudecode-paper-proofreading/prompts/01_latex_workspace_review.md /path/to/your/paper/CLAUDE.md
```

## :bulb: Design Principles

- **Detect first, fix later** — Claude never modifies files until the user explicitly confirms
- **Modular categories** — each check is a labeled block; reorder or disable by editing the table at the top of each prompt
- **Real-world patterns** — rules extracted from annotated paper reviews across ICRA, RA-L, AAAI, BMVC, and CVPR submissions
- **Non-native writer aware** — covers patterns common in papers by Korean/Japanese researchers
- **`figures/` vs `pics/`** — distinguishes final manuscript figures from raw image sources
